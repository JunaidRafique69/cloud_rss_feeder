# RSSParserResource

## Summary
The `RSSParserResource` class is a Flask resource designed to facilitate the parsing of RSS feeds. It efficiently handles the retrieval of the feed URL from the request data, checks the parsing timestamp to determine if the feed has been parsed within the last 10 minutes, and returns previously parsed results if available. In case of an outdated parse or no prior parsing, it proceeds to fetch the feed, extract the main title and description, retrieve all article links, fetch each article link, extract article titles and descriptions, save the parsed data to the database, and finally returns the parsed articles.

## Example Usage
```python
# Create an instance of the RSSParserResource class
rss_parser = RSSParserResource()

# Make a POST request to parse an RSS feed
response = rss_parser.post()

# Print the response
print(response)
